# BooleanProposition
Implementation of boolean logic and some operators. Plus a helper for checking satisfiability.

There are two examples in main.cpp. Feel free to run them.

By using Boolean* you can make memory leaks very easy. I suggest that for making propositions you stick to this format:
Proposition [name] = [another proposition or a combination of helper functions defined in Proposition.h]
